Analysis of data is my passion. My name is Rakibul Sitab and I’m from Bangladesh.I’m an optical engineer by education, data analyst by heart. I’ve switched from an engineering background to a data analyst. When I started my data analyst journey for the first time, I was incredibly lost; there were very few opportunities for me to learn from scratch. I opted to start both the Yandex practicum 100 Data Analyst program and the Udacity nanodegree program at the same time and received a promising opportunity to learn. Practicum 100 is a 9-month intensive program designed to train 100 talents to become professional data analysts in Germany.
